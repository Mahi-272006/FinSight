# FinSight — Implementation Log

Chronological record of every milestone: what was built, what commands were run,
what was tested, what is still missing, and what comes next.

---

## M0 — Project Setup

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Date:** 2026-10-31
**Commit:** `ee8999d`

### Starting point (inspection findings)

- Project root: `E:\FinSight` (a `D:\FinSight` path was referenced in the
  original brief but does not exist; confirmed with the user that `E:\FinSight`
  is correct).
- `backend/` had a complete folder skeleton (~60 Python files) — **all empty
  (0 bytes)**, awaiting implementation.
- `backend/venv/` existed with Python 3.10.11 but only pip/setuptools installed.
- `frontend/` was a fresh Vite + React 19 scaffold with `node_modules`
  installed; no router/axios/recharts yet.
- `requirements.txt` was empty; `.env` was empty; `.gitignore` was empty;
  `README.md` was empty.
- PostgreSQL 18.3 was already installed and running as a Windows service
  (`postgresql-x64-18`), but `psql` was not on PATH; it lives at
  `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\18\bin\`.
- The directory was **not** a git repository.

### Files created / changed

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.gitignore` (root) | Protects `.env`, `venv/`, `data/*`, `logs/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/` from being committed |
| `backend/requirements.txt` | Pinned-range dependency list, grouped by concern, with Windows torch note |
| `backend/.env` | Environment template with placeholders (empty API keys, SEC User-Agent, DB URL, Chroma path) |
| `README.md` (root) | Project overview, design principles, setup instructions, roadmap |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Beginner-friendly explanation of all components, data flow, and design rationale |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md` | This file |
| `backend/pytest.ini` | Pytest config: test discovery, `asyncio_mode=auto` for M5/M6 async tests, known-warning filter |
| `backend/tests/conftest.py` | Shared fixture stub (filled per milestone) |
| `backend/tests/test_smoke.py` | 3 smoke tests proving pytest + async mode + package imports work |
| `backend/scripts/verify_environment.py` | 27-check environment verifier (imports, versions, integration smoke checks) |

### Decisions made

1. **Install CPU-only PyTorch first** (`--index-url .../whl/cpu`) before
   `requirements.txt`. Reason: on Windows the default PyTorch wheel pulls
   ~2.5 GB of CUDA libraries; the CPU build (~200 MB) is sufficient for the
   small all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model and keeps the install zero-cost and
   fast.
2. **Pin dependency *ranges* (`>=X,<Y`) rather than exact versions** in
   `requirements.txt`. Reason: ranges document compatibility intent; exact
   pins can be added later (e.g. a `requirements-lock.txt`) once the stack is
   proven to work together, avoiding premature pinning to untested versions.
3. **Keep the existing empty file skeleton** rather than restructuring — it
   matches the architecture in the brief.

### Commands executed

```powershell
git init                                              # initialized repo
& "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\18\bin\psql.exe" -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE finsight;"   # by user
venv\Scripts\pip.exe install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu   # torch 2.14.1+cpu
venv\Scripts\pip.exe install -r requirements.txt      # 151 packages total
python scripts/verify_environment.py                  # 27/27 checks passed, exit 0
python -m pytest -q                                   # 3 passed, exit 0
git add -A && git commit                              # ee8999d
```

### Tests performed

1. **Environment verification** (`scripts/verify_environment.py`): all 24
   packages import cleanly. Three deeper integration checks passed:
   - `langchain_core.tools.tool` decorator constructs a working tool
     (proves LangChain tool-calling wiring, not just the import)
   - `langgraph.graph` START/END constants resolve
   - SQLAlchemy engine + connection via in-memory SQLite
2. **Pytest harness** (`tests/test_smoke.py`): 3 tests passed —
   sync test, async test (confirms `asyncio_mode=auto`), `import app`.

### Installed versions (key packages)

| Package | Version |
|---|---|
| Python | 3.10.11 |
| torch (CPU) | 2.14.1+cpu |
| langgraph | 0.6.11 |
| langchain-core | 0.3.86 |
| langchain-groq | 0.3.8 |
| langchain-google-genai | 2.1.12 |
| fastapi | 0.162.0 |
| sqlalchemy | 2.0.55 |
| alembic | 1.20.1 |
| psycopg | 3.3.6 |
| chromadb | 1.5.9 |
| sentence-transformers | 3.4.1 |
| scikit-learn | 1.7.2 |
| pandas | 2.3.3 |
| numpy | 2.2.6 |
| pytest | 8.4.2 |

### Known risks / warnings observed

- **Google Python 3.10 deprecation:** importing `langchain_google_genai`
  prints a FutureWarning — Google has stopped updating `google.api_core`
  for Python 3.10. Works today; affects only the Gemini fallback provider.
  Action deferred to M5 (when Gemini is actually integrated) — options then:
  keep 3.10 while it works, or upgrade the venv to 3.11+.
- `langgraph` emits a `LangChainPendingDeprecationWarning` about checkpoint
  serde defaults — cosmetic, no functional impact; revisit in M6 when
  checkpointing is implemented.

### Current limitations

- No application logic implemented yet; all `app/` files are still empty
  (verified importable, but containing no code).
- `.env` contains placeholders — user must supply real `GROQ_API_KEY` /
  `GEMINI_API_KEY`, a real SEC contact email, and the PostgreSQL password.
  (User has created the `finsight` database.)
- Frontend remains the untouched Vite scaffold.

### Next milestone

**M1 — SEC Data Ingestion:** `sec_client.py` (httpx, User-Agent, throttling,
retries), company identifier resolution (ticker/CIK), Company Facts retrieval,
raw JSON storage, `scripts/ingest_company.py`. First working target: retrieve
and inspect Microsoft's historical financial facts.
